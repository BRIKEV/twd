## Quick Example

**VIDEO HERE** - *Overview of TWD in action - showing the sidebar, running tests, and seeing results in real-time*

```ts
import { describe, it, twd, userEvent } from "twd-js";

describe("User login", () => {
  it("should login successfully", async () => {
    twd.visit("/login");
    
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    const emailInput = await twd.get("input#email");
    const passwordInput = await twd.get("input#password");
    const loginButton = await twd.get("button[type='submit']");
    
    await user.type(emailInput.el, "user@example.com");
    await user.type(passwordInput.el, "password123");
    await user.click(loginButton.el);
    
    const welcome = await twd.get("h1");
    welcome.should("contain.text", "Welcome");
  });
});
```

## Why TWD?

TWD bridges the gap between development and testing by bringing tests directly into your development environment. Instead of running tests in a separate terminal, you can see results instantly in your browser's sidebar while you code.

Perfect for:
- **Frontend developers** who want immediate test feedback
- **Teams** practicing Testing while Developing (TWD)
- **React applications** that need comprehensive UI testing
- **Projects** requiring API mocking and integration testing
