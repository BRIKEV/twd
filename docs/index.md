## Quick Example

See TWD in action with the test sidebar running tests directly in your browser:

<p align="center">
  <img src="/images/twd_side_bar_success.png" alt="TWD Sidebar showing test execution" width="800">
</p>

```ts
import { twd, userEvent, screenDom } from "twd-js";
import { describe, it } from "twd-js/runner";

describe("Hello World Page", () => {
  it("should display the welcome title and counter button", async () => {
    await twd.visit("/");
    
    // Option 1: Use TWD's native selectors
    const title = await twd.get("h1");
    title.should("be.visible").should("have.text", "Welcome to TWD");
    
    const counterButton = await twd.get("button");
    counterButton.should("be.visible").should("have.text", "Count is 0");
    
    const user = userEvent.setup();
    await user.click(counterButton.el);
    counterButton.should("have.text", "Count is 1");
    
    // Option 2: Use Testing Library queries (semantic, accessible)
    // const title = screenDom.getByRole("heading", { name: /welcome to twd/i });
    // twd.should(title, "be.visible");
    // twd.should(title, "have.text", "Welcome to TWD");
    // 
    // const counterButton = screenDom.getByRole("button", { name: /count is/i });
    // twd.should(counterButton, "be.visible");
    // twd.should(counterButton, "have.text", "Count is 0");
    // 
    // await user.click(counterButton);
    // twd.should(counterButton, "have.text", "Count is 1");
  });
});
```

## Why TWD?

TWD bridges the gap between development and testing by bringing tests directly into your development environment. Instead of running tests in a separate terminal, you can see results instantly in your browser's sidebar while you code.

Perfect for:
- **Frontend developers** who want immediate test feedback
- **Teams** practicing Testing while Developing (TWD)
- **React applications** that need comprehensive UI testing
- **Projects** requiring API mocking and integration testing
