# TWD Docs Tutorial — Test While Developing

This repository contains the complete tutorial series for **TWD (Test While Developing)** — a minimal JavaScript testing library designed to run **inside your app** while you develop.  
Each part of this tutorial explores a different aspect of building a modern testing workflow with **Vite**, **React Router**, and **TWD**, from basic setup to continuous integration and coverage.

> The idea behind TWD is simple:  
> **Test while you develop — no context switching, no extra setup, just instant feedback.**
